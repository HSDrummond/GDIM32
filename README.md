Farming Frenzy

Elevator Pitch:
Farming Frenzy is a 2 player, local muliplayer, competitive top-down farming simulator game!
When the game begins, boths players are tasked with a 3 item order! Navigate the farm and
find the items that you need! Make sure you watch out for the farm animals, some of them
might be aggressive! Whichever player completes the most orders when the timer runs out wins!

At the current iteration, use the arrow keys or WASD to move around and press E to pick up crops or animals. You have 60 seconds to collect 5. Right now you need to re-run the program every time since the game freezes when load back in after winning once.The lose screen is just sending you back to the main screen

Controls:
Player 1 uses WASD to move, E tap to pick up items, and E hold to drop your most currently picked up item.
Player 2 uses Arrow Keys to move, / tap to pick up items, and / hold to drop your most currently picked up item.

Rules:
Player 1 is on the left and Player 2 are on the right.
When the game starts, a timer starts for 60 seconds.


Deliverables:

1. Game has a menu to start the game
2. You can win by collecting 5 crops and lose by running out of time
3. 2 Families are the crops which spawn on patches and animals that chase after you.
- Assets are almost done but not implemented
4. In game UI that displays the timer and the amount of both families picked up
