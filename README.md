Farming Frenzy

Elevator Pitch:
Farming Frenzy is a 2 player, local muliplayer, competitive top-down farming simulator game!
When the game begins, boths players are tasked with a 3 item order! Navigate the farm and
find the items that you need! Make sure you watch out for the farm animals, some of them
might be aggressive! Whichever player completes the most orders when the timer runs out wins!

*Note*
- Crops in the tree is intentional.
- Bull Will push you into you hit a wall or some other object. This is so it causes a real threat!
- AI Player can break sometimes. This is due to 2D Navmesh shenegains. TIP: Don't use navmesh and use A* if enough time.

Controls:
Player 1 uses WASD to move, E tap to pick up items, and E hold to drop your most currently picked up item.
Player 2 uses Arrow Keys to move, / tap to pick up items, and / hold to drop your most currently picked up item.

Rules:
Player 1 is on the left and Player 2 are on the right.
When the game starts, a timer starts for 60 seconds.
Players will move around to collect items to complete orders.
The player with the most orders wins!


Deliverables:

1. There is an AI mode where you can race against the AI as if it was an actual player

2. To gain back points that we lost on the AI last time we have upgraded the AI as promised and there are now two entirly diferent state machines that control the passive mobs and the aggresive cow.

3. You can pick up animal products as well! 

4. There is variance in each of the 2 families

5. Increased UI that we lost points on last time
