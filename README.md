A two player competitive, light-hearted, and fun farming game where players are tasked with completing as many orders as possible to win the game, while also having ways to mess up the opposing player trying to complete their own orders. We have a variety of both crops (corn, tomatoes, melons, etc.) and animals (pigs, cows, chickens, etc.) that can be used by the player to gather specific items the merchants may need to fulfill orders. The goal of the game/win condition is to complete as many orders as you possibly can while doing your best to inhibit the other player from doing the same thing. We have a variety of sickles within the game that can be used to disrupt and grab other players as well as other objects to add another element of fun and spontaneity. Each player also has a timer, which adds an element of stress and forces them to move as quickly as possible in order to beat the other player. This also encourages messing up their opponent as much as possible to add to the competitive nature of the game. The outcome is such that you put them at a disadvantage by giving them less time to complete their orders, potentially sabotaging them.  

**At the current iteration, use the arrow keys or WASD to move around and press E to pick up crops or animals. You have 60 seconds to collect 5. Right now you need to re-run the program every time since the game freezes when load back in after winning once.The lose screen is just sending you back to the main screen**

Deliverables:

1. Game has a menu to start the game
2. You can win by collecting 5 crops and lose by running out of time
3. 2 Families are the crops which spawn on patches and animals that chase after you.
- Assets are almost done but not implimented
4. In game UI that displays the timer and the amount of both families picked up
